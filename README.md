These are my various configs, minus potentially sensitive stuff.

I'm very aggressive with shell aliases, to the point of renaming 'cat' to 'r' for 'read', etc. I honestly think
there's no excuse for such basic commands not being one letter.

`nano/default.nanorc` is the other substantial thing here. It's a syntax highlighting scheme for thought files
(which I use very frequently) designed to help me organize my thoughts and improve productivity. I can't begin
to describe how much value I've gotten out of that investment since I first came up with the idea.
